Electronic City (E-City) is another one of Bangalore's largest IT hubs, located in the southern outskirts. It is divided into three phases and houses hundreds of tech companies, including major campuses for Infosys and Wipro.

Lifestyle and Vibe:
The vibe is entirely work-focused. It's a planned township with good infrastructure within its boundaries, including the elevated expressway that connects it to the city. The lifestyle is convenient for those working within E-City but lacks the cultural vibrancy of central Bangalore.

Rent and Housing:
Rents are very affordable compared to the rest of Bangalore. A 1BHK can be as low as ₹8,000 to ₹15,000, and a 2BHK is often available for ₹15,000 to ₹25,000. Housing is primarily in large apartment complexes.

Pros:
Extremely affordable rental prices.
Walk-to-work concept for employees of companies within E-City.
Good internal infrastructure and connectivity via the elevated expressway.

Cons:
Located on the absolute outskirts of the city, making commutes elsewhere very long.
Limited options for entertainment and dining compared to other areas.
Can feel like a corporate bubble, detached from the main city.
